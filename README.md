# DeckOfBlockyThings
A Deck of Many Things in Minecraft.
We are taking the full deck of many things as we understand it to exist per the defination for D&D 5e and changing the mechanics to fit within a minecraft setting. 

DOBTxxx are code files just fyi.

What the cards will look like rules wise (our current ideas for the cards as per the first of April 2019): 
Note: refrences to the "modpack" are a custom modpack we are using to test this mod.  

The following text contains swearing, you have been warned. 


Balance: Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your health / hunger and potion effects to flip.  Strength becomes weakness, max health becomes 1 heart, full hunger becomes 1 hunger etc.

Comet: If you defeat the monster this card will summon (random monster) you encounter, you gain Experience Points enough to gain one level (or a fuckton if i cant work out how to code that). Otherwise, this card has no effect.

Donjon: You are trapped in a prison of obsidian, from 1-5 blocks thick really high up in the air.  Really high up in the air.   Super high.  Also you have mining fatige becuase fuck you.

Euryale: The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You have permanent weakness and slowness while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.

The Fates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to cancel all potion effects (even permanent ones) or edit your exp levels by 30 or receive one item. You must use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card.

Flames: A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

Fool: You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. 

Gem: you receive a fuckton of gold, diamonds, exp bottles, enchanted books and whatever else is valuable in this god-forsaken modpack.

Idiot: lose a tool from your hotbar, if there are no tools on your hotbar then you lose a few levels or bits of armor where applicable, if you have nothing but the deck then you summon like 5 silverfish. You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

Jester: You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

Key: An enchanted weapon appears in your inventory or on the ground next to you (if your inventory is full) this will be mildly useful and not random

Knight: You gain the service of 2 iron golems, who appears in a space near you (within 10 blocks) if they can.  If not then the card fails and the golems die and you should feel bad

Moon: You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.  Summons an admin to grant your wishes.

Rogue: an invisible random hostile mob is summoned within 30 blocks of you.  If possible to code it will teleport to within 30 blocks of you if you leave the radius of 30 blocks from it and will continue to do so until you kill it.

Ruin: all your stuff is gone now, includes items, levels and friendships.  If you whine about it then the admins will delete your house as well.

Skull: You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid Skeleton clad in full diamond and carrying a super-op weapon. It appears in a space within 20 blocks of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 Hit Points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. 

Star: Increase your max health by 2 hearts. The score can exceed X but can't exceed Y.

Sun: You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item appears in your hands.

Talons: Every enchanted item you wear or carry disintegrates. 

Throne: You gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of Monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.  

The Void: This black card Spells Disaster. You trigger a clear inventory and teleport to the void, instantly.  No grave, no keep inventory, no friends and somewhere in the world a hopeless puppy dies alone.  You are also given the death message “XXX was an arsehole and killed a puppy”  The admins laugh at your expense.



Technically new cards: 



Planes (evil): you are sent to a random dimension.  

Portal(nuet): you and another random player swap positions.  If no players are online then you teleport somewhere random.

Adventure(FUCKING BRUTAL): you are now in adventure mode till you die

Beacon (decent): a chest appears with materials to make a lvl1 beacon, one beacon block and 9 blocks for the beacon's base

Boat Lich (God-Like): spawns an unarmed skeleton with a hat in a boat.  

Engineer (decent): Gives the player a small amount of redstone resources; redstone, repeaters, pistons, etc.

Vizier of the lake (nuet): Literally spawns the panzer of the lake
